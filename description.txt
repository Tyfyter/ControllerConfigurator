Allows greater customization of controls.
Currently allows you to move and shoot with the gamepad radial hotbar open, lets you bind a key to use the mouse with the right stick, and lets you bind controls to combination of inputs (use your tile interaction keybind in the controls menu, right click/left button by default) 
If you think of an addition to this mod you'd like to see, feel free to comment it, I'll probably add it.
